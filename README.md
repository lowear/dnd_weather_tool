# dnd_weather_tool
A nerdy tool that generates map weather for Gareth's even nerdier DnD campaigns.

## A note to my dearest friend, Gareth Onee-Chan
Thou art nerdy, thou art great, even if thou art a DnD reprobate. <br />
May this tool bring you weather, both good and bad. <br />
May your DnD games make you both happy, and sad. <br />
With this tool may your players cast many great spells, whilst you subject them to numerous hells. <br />
I hope, dearest Gareth, that this tool is a blast. <br />
I want you to know, that I cherish our past. <br />
<br />
All the best, <br />
Daddy Lowe <br />

This is a very toughing note, and I'm thankful for the assistance in creating a random tool for an extremely niche use case
