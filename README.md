# dnd_weather_tool
A nerdy tool that generates map weather for Gareth's even nerdier DnD campaigns.

## A note to my dearest friend, Gareth Onee-Chan
Thou art nerdy, thou art great, even if thou art a DnD reprobate.
May this tool bring you weather, both good and bad.
May your DnD games make you both happy, and sad.
With this tool may your players cast many great spells, whilst you subject them to numerous hells.
I hope, dearest Gareth, that this tool is a blast.
I want you to know, that I cherish our past.

All the best,
Daddy Lowe
